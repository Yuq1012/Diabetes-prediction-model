# Diabetes-prediction-model
About dataset 
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. In this project, we will find a suitable machine learning model to predict the diabetes. In this dataset there have several medical predictor variables and one target dependent variable(outcome).
